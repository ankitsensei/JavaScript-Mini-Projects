# Features of the Form ðŸš€

## âœ¨Responsive Design:

The form is designed to look good on all devices, thanks to its use of modern HTML and CSS. This means it will work well on smartphones, tablets, and computers.

## âœ¨User-Friendly Interface:

The form includes clear labels and placeholders to guide users on what information to enter.
Error messages appear in real-time, helping users to correct mistakes as they fill out the form.

## âœ¨Real-Time Validation:

**Full Name**: The form checks that the user has entered their full name (first and last name).
**Phone Number**: The form ensures the phone number is exactly 10 digits long and consists only of numbers.
**Email**: The form verifies that the email address is in a valid format (e.g., user@example.com).
**Message**: The form requires the message to be at least 30 characters long, ensuring that users provide enough detail.

## âœ¨Visual Feedback:

When users enter information correctly, a green checkmark icon appears next to the field.
If thereâ€™s an error, a red message appears, indicating what needs to be fixed.

## âœ¨Submit Button:

The submit button is enabled only when all fields are correctly filled out.
If there are any errors, a message appears, prompting users to fix them before the form can be submitted.

# How It Works

**Real-Time Feedback**: As you type into each field, the form checks your input and provides immediate feedback. For example, if you enter an incorrect phone number, it will tell you right away.
**Error Messages**: If any information is missing or incorrect, a message will appear next to the relevant field explaining what needs to be fixed.
**Confirmation**: Once all fields are correctly filled out, the form will allow you to submit it, ensuring that all information provided is valid.
