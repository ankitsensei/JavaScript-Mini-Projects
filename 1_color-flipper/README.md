# Color-Flipper

This program creates a simple interactive web application that allows you to change the background color of the webpage. It functions like a "color flipper". ðŸ˜Š

Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

## âœ¨ Displays Color Options:
The webpage shows four buttons labeled "Green", "Red", "Blue", and "Random".

## âœ¨ Changes Background Color:
Clicking any of the first three buttons (Green, Red, Blue) changes the background color of the entire webpage to the corresponding color.

## âœ¨ Generates Random Colors:
Clicking the "Random" button generates a random color code and sets the background color of the webpage to that random color. It also updates the button text to display the specific color code it generated (e.g., rgb(100, 50, 200)).

## In essence ðŸ‘‡
This program provides a user-friendly way to experiment with different background colors for the webpage through button interaction.
